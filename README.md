Power BI Project Summary: Flight Performance Analysis
Project Title: Flight Performance Analysis for January 1st, 2015
Data source: www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv
Objective:
The primary goal of this Power BI report is to analyze the performance of flights on January 1st, 2015, including metrics such as Total flights, On-Time flights, percentage On-time, Delay flights, percentage delay, cancelled flight, and percentage cancelled. This analysis will provide insights into airline performance, flight punctuality, and operational efficiency on this specific day.

Data Overview:
•	Date Range: January 1st, 2015
•	Airlines: Various airlines including Alaska Airlines (AS), American Airlines (AA), Delta Airlines (DL), United Airlines (UA), and others.
•	Total Flights Recorded: Data includes numerous flights with information on departure and arrival details.
•	Key Metrics:
•	Departure Delay
•	Arrival Delay
•	Taxi Out/Taxi In Times
•	Flight Distance
•	Elapsed Airtime
•	Cancellations and Diversions
•	Delay Reasons: Air System Delay, Security Delay, Airline Delay, Weather Delay, Late Aircraft
Key Measures for Analysis:
1.	Total Flights by Airline: Analyze the distribution of flights among various airlines.
2.	Average Departure and Arrival Delays by Airline: Calculate the average delay to assess airline performance.
3.	Delay Breakdown: Break down delay reasons (weather, security, airline, late aircraft) to identify key factors affecting punctuality.
4.	Cancellations Descriptions: Visualize the number of cancelled and diverted flights for each airline by several reasons.
5.	Flight Duration and Distance: Visualize flight times and distances to understand long-haul vs. short-haul flights and their associated delays.
6.	Top Delayed Flights: Highlight the most delayed flights to bring attention to significant outliers.

Visuals & Reports in Power BI:
Flight Distribution (Bar Chart)
•	Displays the number of flights per airline by Cities.
•	Filterable by airport, day of the week, and other attributes.
Delayed by Airline (Bar Chart)
•	A bar chart that shows the delays for each airline.
•	A trendline can show delay performance throughout the other attributes.
Cancellations by Descriptions (Donut Chart)
•	A breakdown of flights cancelled or diverted by several reasons like Weather factor, security, National Air system, and Airline/ Carrier.
•	Filterable by airlines, airports and other attributes.
Cancellation by Day of week (Column Chart)
•	Displays flight cancellations at different weekdays.
•	Helps identify the days if the week with highest and lowest cancellations to assist passengers in making informed decisions.
•	Filterable by airlines, airports and other attributes.

Flight Status (Cards)
•	A breakdown of percentage Delayed, Cancelled, and On-time flights, 
Flight State in the US (Slicer)
•	Filter by states in the US on all attributes
Overview of flight details (Table)
•	A table displaying flights overview on (Airlines, IATA codes, Flight status, flight status percentage, total flights and distinct day of week.)
•	Includes the airline cancellation reasons in table row filter.


Insights to Derive:
•	Which airlines consistently meet their scheduled times, and which have significant delays?
•	Which airports experience the highest ground delays?
•	What are the most common causes of flight delays in 2015?
•	Are there patterns in delays based on weekday?
•	How do certain descriptions (conditions) affect cancellation and delays?
Audience:
•	Airline Operations Managers: To understand flight delay causes and improve operational efficiency.
•	Airport Authorities: To address airport-specific issues.
•	Customer Service Teams: To better prepare for handling delays and cancellations.
Conclusion:
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive view of airline performance on January 1st, 2015. Through detailed visualizations and insights, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement, reduce delays, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

Next Steps:
•	Automate data updates to track daily or monthly trends.
•	Incorporate real-time data for live monitoring of flight delays and performance.
•	Add drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis of specific airlines or airports.
